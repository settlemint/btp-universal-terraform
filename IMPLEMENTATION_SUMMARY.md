# Implementation Summary - Automatic Destroy Fix

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Pre-Destroy Hook for LoadBalancer Cleanup ✅
**File:** `main.tf:40-75`

Added a `null_resource` that runs BEFORE the Kubernetes cluster is destroyed:

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "cleanup_k8s_loadbalancers" {
  count = contains(["aws", "azure", "gcp"], try(var.k8s_cluster.mode, "disabled")) ? 1 : 0

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = destroy
    command = <<-EOT
      kubectl delete svc --all -A --field-selector spec.type=LoadBalancer --timeout=120s || true
      sleep 30
    EOT
  }

  depends_on = [
    module.k8s_cluster,
    module.ingress_tls,
    module.metrics_logs
  ]
}
```

**How it works:**
1. When you run `terraform destroy`, this runs FIRST
2. It deletes all Kubernetes LoadBalancer services (which create AWS NLBs/ELBs)
3. Waits 30 seconds for AWS to clean up ENIs
4. Then continues with normal destroy order

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully automatic - no manual intervention needed
- ✅ Works for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- ✅ Skips for BYO mode (bring your own cluster)
- ✅ Uses `|| true` so it doesn't fail if kubectl fails

### 2. Fixed Conditional Resource Dependency
**File:** `main.tf:77-79`

**Before:**
```hcl
depends_on = [
  module.k8s_cluster,
  local_file.kubeconfig  # ❌ Doesn't exist in BYO mode
]
```

**After:**
```hcl
depends_on = [
  module.k8s_cluster  # ✅ Always exists
]
```

### 3. Added Lifecycle Policies to Helm Releases
**File:** `deps/metrics_logs/main.tf`

```hcl
lifecycle {
  create_before_destroy = false
}
```

Ensures proper destroy order for helm releases.

### 4. Updated ENI Cleanup Script
**File:** `scripts/cleanup-stuck-enis.sh`

- Now detects K8s-related ENIs (`aws-K8S-*`)
- Automatically detaches and deletes them
- Works with 1Password credentials

### 5. Created Force VPC Delete Script
**File:** `scripts/force-delete-vpc.sh`

For extreme cases where VPC won't delete:
- Deletes all ENIs
- Deletes NAT Gateways
- Releases EIPs
- Deletes IGWs, subnets, route tables, security groups
- Finally deletes VPC

## How to Use

### Normal Destroy (Now Works Automatically!) 🎉

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file examples/aws-config.tfvars -auto-approve
```

That's it! The pre-destroy hook handles everything.

### If Destroy Still Fails (Rare)

```bash
# Option 1: Clean up ENIs
./scripts/cleanup-stuck-enis.sh vpc-XXXXX

# Option 2: Force delete entire VPC
./scripts/force-delete-vpc.sh vpc-XXXXX

# Then retry destroy
terraform destroy -var-file examples/aws-config.tfvars -auto-approve
```

## What Was The Problem?

**Root Cause:**
- Kubernetes LoadBalancer services create AWS Network Load Balancers
- NLBs create ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) in your subnets
- When Terraform destroys the EKS cluster, kubectl stops working
- Orphaned ENIs prevent subnet deletion
- Terraform waits forever (we saw 13+ minutes, sometimes 2+ days!)

**Why Previous Approach Failed:**
1. Destroying EKS cluster first → kubectl stops working
2. Can't delete LoadBalancers → ENIs remain
3. Can't delete subnets → have ENIs attached
4. Terraform hangs indefinitely

**Why New Approach Works:**
1. Pre-destroy hook runs FIRST (while kubectl still works)
2. Deletes all LoadBalancer services → AWS removes NLBs
3. Waits 30s for AWS to detach ENIs
4. Then destroys cluster → clean, no orphaned resources
5. Subnets/VPC delete quickly

## Testing Status

❌ **Not yet tested** - Current VPC was manually force-deleted

### Next Steps to Verify:
1. Deploy a fresh stack: `terraform apply`
2. Test destroy: `terraform destroy`
3. Should complete in ~5-7 minutes (not 13+ minutes or days!)
4. Check no orphaned ENIs remain

## Files Changed

1. `main.tf` - Added pre-destroy hook + fixed depends_on
2. `deps/metrics_logs/main.tf` - Added lifecycle policies
3. `scripts/cleanup-stuck-enis.sh` - Enhanced ENI detection
4. `scripts/force-delete-vpc.sh` - New force cleanup script
5. `CODE_REVIEW.md` - Full code review findings
6. `DESTROY_ISSUES.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
7. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
terraform destroy
  ↓
Destroys: EKS cluster (4-5 min)
  ↓
Tries to destroy: Subnet
  ⏱️ HANGS FOR 13+ MINUTES (or days!)
  ↓
Error: Subnet has dependencies (ENIs)
```

### After Fix:
```
terraform destroy
  ↓
Pre-destroy hook: Deletes LoadBalancers (30s)
  ↓
Destroys: Helm releases (1-2 min)
  ↓
Destroys: EKS cluster (4-5 min)
  ↓
Destroys: Subnets (1-2s each)
  ↓
Destroys: VPC (30s-1min)
  ↓
✅ COMPLETE in ~7 minutes
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Kubectl must be available** during destroy
   - The pre-destroy hook needs kubectl
   - If kubectl is not in PATH, it will fail (but won't block destroy)

2. **AWS permissions needed**
   - EIP release might fail with permission errors (harmless)
   - VPC will still delete successfully

3. **Timing** is approximate
   - AWS cleanup can be slow (NAT Gateways take 1-2 minutes)
   - VPC deletion depends on AWS API speed
